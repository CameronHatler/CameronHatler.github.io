	<h2> Title: Predicting Sports Outcomes </h2>
	<h3> Project Description </h3>
	<p>The goal of this project will be to assess whether neural networks can be applied to predict sports games outcomes and other various 'lines' often used for sports betting. I'm not personally interested in sports betting, but the potential to 'beat' a large company in these chance scenarios is very intriguing. It is also an educational project because there would be a lot of things to consider when thinking about what effects different outcomes which would be able to highlight the human decisions made in creating the model to come up with good predictions. The plan would be successful if the model used were able to go 'positive' when placing bets against an online sports betting company such as FanDuel. </p>
	<h3> Project Goals </h3>
	<ol>
		<li> Create/find a model to predict outcomes of certain sports </li>
		<li> Create/find a model that predicts outcomes of smaller decisions such as points scored, how well a particular athlete does, or who scores the first points </li>
		<li> Compare results of the models to the 'lines' set by sports betting companies and see how it fares. </li>
	</ol>
